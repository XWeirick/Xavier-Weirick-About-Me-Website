        <p>I decided to make a page dedicated to highlighting some of my favorite bands, because listening to music is
            one
            of my favorite hobbies. I also think that music is a great way to express emotion, whether it is by the
            lyrics, or the instruments. I believe that there is a certain type of music for everyone out there, and they
            might not even know they like it! I also hope that by going through my list of bands, you give some of them
            a listen if you haven't heard of them already!
            However, music taste is subjective, so some of these bands might not fit your taste.</p>

    <h2><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deftones" target="blank">Deftones</a></u></h2>
    <img src="images/deftones.jpg">
    <section id="deftones">
        <p>The first of my favorite bands is Deftones. I’ve always been drawn to how they blend aggression with an
            almost dreamlike atmosphere. Their music has this ability to take you to another place, hitting hard with
            intense riffs and then pulling you into softer, more haunting moments. Chino Moreno’s voice perfectly
            captures that mix of power and vulnerability, which makes their songs feel raw and real. Albums like White
            Pony and Around the Fur are favorites because they push boundaries and aren’t afraid to explore heavier,
            more emotional themes. Listening to their music is like a journey, and there’s always something new to
            discover with each track.
            <br>
            <br>
            Deftones also resonate with me because their music is never one-dimensional—it’s layered and complex, much
            like the feelings it brings up. Songs like “Change (In the House of Flies)” and “Digital Bath” hit that
            perfect balance between beauty and darkness, which keeps me coming back to them. Each album feels like a new
            chapter in their evolution, and I love how they’re always willing to experiment with their sound. There’s an
            authenticity to Deftones that makes me feel connected to their music, no matter how many times I listen.

    <img src="images/bringmethehorizon.jpg">
    <section id="bringmethehorizon">
        <p>The next band that I really love is Bring Me The Horizon. I’m drawn to them because of how much they’ve
            evolved over the years, transforming from a heavy metalcore sound to a mix of rock, pop, and electronic
            elements. This evolution keeps their music feeling fresh, and I really appreciate how they take risks and
            push boundaries. Oli Sykes’ vocals, which range from powerful screams to softer, melodic tones, give their
            music a raw intensity, and it feels like every song has something to say. Albums like Sempiternal and That's
            the Spirit are favorites of mine—they perfectly capture that mix of heaviness and accessibility that makes
            their sound so unique.
            <br>
            <br>
            What I love most about Bring Me The Horizon is their willingness to experiment and grow with each album.
            Tracks like “Drown” and “Can You Feel My Heart” are deeply emotional, and I find their lyrics relatable and
            cathartic. Their music captures a lot of modern struggles and emotions, making their songs feel both intense
            and honest. Whether they’re creating something heavy or more melodic, Bring Me The Horizon never loses that
            emotional depth, and that’s what keeps me listening.

    <h2><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invent_Animate" target="blank">Invent Animate</a></u></h2>
    <img src="images/inventanimate.jpg">
    <section id="inventanimate">
        <p>A band that I have recently discovered and find really interesting is a band called Invent Animate. I was
            immediately drawn to their unique mix of progressive metalcore and atmospheric elements that give their
            music an immersive, almost cinematic quality. Their guitar work is complex and layered, creating soundscapes
            that feel intense yet captivating. Marcus Vik’s vocals add a lot to their dynamic sound—he shifts
            effortlessly between powerful screams and clean vocals, which brings a lot of emotion and depth to their
            songs. Their album Heavener has become a favorite of mine because of its intricate instrumentals and raw,
            introspective lyrics.
            <br>
            <br>
            I find Invent Animate interesting because their music feels like a journey, full of rich textures and
            emotional highs and lows. Songs like “Celestial Floods” and “The Sun Sleeps” hit that perfect blend of
            heaviness and beauty, making their music feel both intense and thoughtful. They’re able to explore themes of
            struggle and growth in a way that feels genuine, which I really connect with. Invent Animate’s music keeps
            me coming back because of its depth, and I’m excited to see how they continue to evolve.

    <h2><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipknot_(band)" target="blank">Slipknot</a></u></h2>
    <img src="images/slipknot.jpg">
    <section id="slipknot">
        <p>A classic band that I love going back to every now and then is Slipknot. There’s something so raw and
            unapologetic about their music that makes it incredibly cathartic. I love how Slipknot channels pure
            aggression and energy, yet their sound is still incredibly tight and technical. Corey Taylor’s intense
            vocals, combined with the driving rhythms and heavy riffs, create a chaotic yet powerful experience that few
            other bands can match. Albums like Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) are albums that I frequent, as
            they capture Slipknot’s perfect balance of brutal heaviness and haunting atmosphere.
            <br>
            <br>
            Slipknot’s music connects with me because it’s not just about loud sounds—it’s about releasing pent-up
            emotions and confronting darker sides of life. Tracks like “Duality” and “Psychosocial” are not only heavy
            but also explore relatable themes of inner turmoil and resilience. I appreciate how Slipknot can tap into
            such intense emotions, making their music feel almost therapeutic. No matter how many times I listen, they
            always bring that adrenaline rush, which is why they remain a favorite to revisit.

    <h2><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Lake_(band)" target="blank">Crystal Lake</a></u></h2>
    <img src="images/crystallake.jpg">
    <section id="crystallake">
        <p>A lesser-known band, but one that has made favorites on my playlists, is a band called Crystal Lake. I love
            their ability to blend heavy, intense metalcore with moments of melody and atmosphere that keep their sound
            interesting and unpredictable. Hailing from Japan, Crystal Lake brings a unique energy to the genre, with
            Ryo Kinoshita’s vocals ranging from fierce screams to clean, soaring melodies that add a ton of emotional
            depth. Albums like Helix and True North stand out because they’re filled with tracks that hit hard yet still
            feel thoughtful and layered.
            <br>
            <br>
            What keeps me coming back to Crystal Lake’s music is the way they combine technical precision with raw
            power. Songs like “Apollo” and “Aeon” have this incredible momentum that feels almost cinematic, with riffs
            and breakdowns that get stuck in my head. Crystal Lake’s sound is intense but never feels repetitive—they’re
            constantly experimenting and finding new ways to keep things fresh. Their music always feels like it has a
            purpose, which is why they’ve earned a solid spot on my playlists.

    <h2><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_Token" target="blank">Sleep Token</a></u></h2>
    <img src="images/sleeptoken.jpg">
    <section id="sleeptoken">
        <p>A band that has quickly risen in popularity in the past few years is a band called Sleep Token. I find their
            music captivating because of how they blend genres like metal, ambient, and R&B, creating a sound that’s
            heavy yet hauntingly beautiful. Fronted by the mysterious figure known as Vessel, Sleep Token’s music is
            filled with rich, emotional depth, and their lyrics explore themes of love, loss, and inner conflict in a
            poetic way. Albums like Sundowning and This Place Will Become Your Tomb are among my favorites because each
            song feels like a deeply personal experience, drawing you into a world that’s both dark and ethereal.
            <br>
            <br>
            What I really love about Sleep Token is how immersive their music is—it feels almost like a ritual. Tracks
            like “The Offering” and “Alkaline” hit hard but also have a delicate, vulnerable side that makes their sound
            so unique. Their blend of intensity and introspection keeps me coming back, as each listen reveals something
            new. Sleep Token’s music feels like an escape, creating a space where you can connect with your emotions,
            and that’s something truly special.</p>
