Peer suggestion #1:

"I would change the color of the background slightly, it makes it tricky to read in some spots as the background is gray and the text is white on my screen"

Peer suggestion #2:

"The title is small, it needs to be bigger to be more easily readable"

Change for Suggestion #1:
I made the background color slightly darker (from 128,128,128 to 66,66,66). 
Originally, I had the thought that most people would prefer a darker background to make it easier on the eyes, 
but I will likely have to change it to dark text over a light background to follow Typographical guidelines.

Change for Suggestion #2:
I have bolded and increased the font size for the header across all pages to 150% of the universal font size to make it easier to read. 
Might increase to around 175% when/if I get more feedback.
