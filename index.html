    <h2 class="heading_class">Some of Xavier's goals in life</h2>
    <p id="index_goals"><em>One of my biggest goals in life is to live debt free (excluding a mortgage and car payments). <br>
      I want to be able to make enough money to where my parents can retire comfortably and not have to <br>
      worry about paying anything off. <br>
        I also want to master the guitar and be able to write music, whether it's for myself, or an audience. <br>
          My last goal (for now) is to be able to inspire at least 1 person.</em></p>
