      <h1 class="heading_class">About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born in Tacoma, WA, and currently live in Port Orchard, WA, with my mom, dad, uncle, and grandma. We also
        own a 6-year-old Golden Retriever named Max (he also really loves to play!). I graduated from high school in
        2023, and I have been attending Olympic College since the Fall of 2023.</p>

      <h2 class="heading_class">My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Throughout my day when I am not mindlessly scrolling on my phone, I like to spend time either playing the
        electric guitar or doing some PC and Console gaming. Every now and then I like to hang out with some of my
        friends, either at their house, or wherever we decide to hangout that day. Some of our favorite places to go to
        are the mall, or Downtown Port Orchard!</p>

      <h3 class="heading_class">My Favorite Games Currently</h3>
      <p>As I said, I like to do some PC and Console gaming every now and then when I am not playing the guitar or
        hanging out. I have always liked shooting games like Call of Duty (I’ve been putting a lot of time into the
        newest
        one!), and more recently, I have gotten into more chill games like Stardew Valley. One of my favorite games
        right
        now though, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_The_Show_24" target="_blank">MLB The Show
          24</a>. I have really enjoyed playing the whole series, going back to MLB The Show
        15 when
        I was 11 years old. I have always had fun creating my own character and absolutely dominating in the Major
        Leagues.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, my two other favorite games right now are story-based games that could possibly go down as
        part of the top 10 in modern story driven games. These two games are <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Myth:_Wukong" target="_blank">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.
        Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in a futuristic, cyberpunk themed city of Night City that is driven by Japanese
        culture, and it lies between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The main story is about fighting back to gain
        freedom against the mega corporations that have had control over the lives of the people of Night City.
        <br>
        <br>
        Black Myth: Wukong, takes place in 7th Century China, and is heavily inspired off the novel Journey to the West.
        You
        play as a monkey labeled as “The Destined One”, as you go through the world in 6 different chapters to find the
        6 different relics that Sun Wukong himself had split into after his fight against Erlang Shen. You can find more
        information about the lore of Wukong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King"

      <h3 class="heading_class">Some of My Favorite Music Genres to Play on the Guitar</h3>
      As I also said, I like to play and practice the electric guitar when I am not playing video games. I have only
      been
      playing for about a year (at the time of writing this), but I have found myself dedicating a lot of time to the
      instrument, because I really think that I actually enjoy playing this instrument, and I see myself sticking to
      playing it for most of my life. The genres that I like to play on the guitar are also genres that I love listening
      to. The first genre that I like playing is Metal. Mostly, I like to play older songs by Bring Me The Horizon,
      Slipknot, and some Suicide Silence. What I really like about Metal is the ability to be able to make heavy music
      and varying paces, such as slowing it way down for a brutal breakdown or speeding it way up for a fast chorus.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another genre that I really enjoy playing is Pop Punk. I like to mostly play songs by Green Day or Blink-182.
      Although I like playing the genre, I do not spend a lot of time playing it, so I know very little. What I like
      about playing the genre, however, is the simplicity of playing it. Most of the song structure in Pop Punk songs
      are mostly built around power chords (wiki link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_chord ), which makes playing
      the songs really simple while still being able to provide a full sound and melody through the amp.
      <br>
      <br>
      The last genre that I like to play is a mix of Alternative Rock and Metal. I play almost exclusively songs by
      Deftones, as I have
      not really delved into the genre, but they are also in my top 3 favorite bands. What I appreciate the most of this
      genre is being able to mix rock and metal elements with slow and ambient sounds to create a rollercoaster of a
      song, which I have found to really enjoy in some of the music that I listen to.

    <section id="goals">
      <h2 class="heading_class">Some of My Goals in Life</h2>
      <p id="index_goals"><em>One of my biggest goals in life is to live debt free (outside of a mortgage and car
          payments). <br>
          I want to be able to make enough money to where my parents can retire comfortably and not have to <br>
          worry about paying anything off. <br>
          I also want to master the guitar and be able to write music, whether it's for myself, or an audience. <br>
          My last goal (for now) is to be able to inspire at least 1 person.</em></p>
