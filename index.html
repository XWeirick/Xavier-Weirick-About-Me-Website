      <h1 class="heading_class">About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born in Tacoma, WA, and currently live in Port Orchard, WA, with my mom, dad, uncle, and grandma. We also
        own a 6-year-old Golden Retriever named Max (he also really loves to play!). I graduated from high school in
        2023, and I have been attending Olympic College since the Fall of 2023.</p>

      <h2 class="heading_class">Some of My Goals in Life</h2>
      <p id="index_goals"><em>One of my biggest goals in life is to live debt free (outside of a mortgage and car
          payments). <br>
          I want to be able to make enough money to where my parents can retire comfortably and not have to <br>
          worry about paying anything off. <br>
          I also want to master the guitar and be able to write music, whether it's for myself, or an audience. <br>
          My last goal (for now) is to be able to inspire at least 1 person.</em></p>
