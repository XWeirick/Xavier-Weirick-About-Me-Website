            <h2 class="heading_class">Why I think Max is the best dog ever</h2>
            <p>He may not be the most perfect dog, and he might be a little goofy at times, but he always brings
                happiness to my family and I. His wagging tail and silly antics never fail to lift our spirits, even on
                the hardest days. He does not have to be the smartest or the most well-behaved dog. However, his loyalty
                and love
                are what truly make him special. That is all he needs to do for him to be the best dog to us, nothing
                more.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_class">What Max Like's to Do During The Day</h2>
            <p>He loves to sit at the top of the stairs, barking at anyone who passes by the house. He is the guardian
                of the house after all! When he decides he wants to go outside, he likes to dart through the backyard
                and chasing after
                rabbits (He's not very inviting sometimes!). When everyone is home, and he isn't up to his usual antics,
                he begs everyone to play his favorite games with him. After a long day of being Max, he sleeps with my
                parents in their bed, tucked in his favorite blanket during the cold Winter months.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_class">Max's Favorite Treats</h2>
            <p>Max really loves his treats! His favorite kinds of treats to eat are bacon bits or chicken jerky tenders.
                And sometimes, we toss him a french fry or two when we get McDonalds. He also really likes to eat peanut
                butter, and sometimes he likes it when peanut butter is on some of his other treats! He doesn't only eat
                bacon or fries, he also eats carrots and lettuce. He's a healthy dog!</p>
